--> Q. Data encapsulation in java.
Ans: Data encapsulation in Java is a concept that restricts direct access to the fields of a class and provides access to them via public methods. It is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe from external interference and misuse. check code "Hello.java" .
This example creates a fully encapsulated class named "Person". This class has private class attributes, setter, and getter methods. The setter methods allow the user to set the values of the private attributes, and the getter methods allow the user to retrieve the values of the private attributes.

Q. Data abstraction in java.
Ans: Data abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept that involves hiding the 
implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the 
object. Here's a concise explanation of data abstraction in Java:
• Definition: Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details 
and showing only the essential features of an object to the outside world. It 
allows for the creation of complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, 
manageable components.
• 2. Abstract Classes and Interfaces: In Java, data abstraction is primarily 
achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is 
a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods, which are 
declared but not implemented. Abstract methods define the interface for 
subclasses to implement. Interfaces, on the other hand, provide a way to specify 
methods that a class must implement, but they cannot contain method 
implementations
